We offer cutting edge flight and ground control systems; PlaneView - information from the Flight Management System and primary flight displays are presented on multiple large format screens that allow pilots to select and view information where and how they want from the enhanced vision system that includes low light, infrared, and three dimensional color images of terrain, equipment interiors and exteriors, obstacles and runways; Intelligence by Wire - fly by light wire (fiber optic links with secure wifi) combined with a network that collects and distributes data from various systems and surfaces and makes that available to other systems, the networks advanced infrastructure lines the airframe with technology that significantly reduced cables and parts, adds more usable redundancy and lightens the airframe. The Field and Airborne Support Team program transports tools, parts, and technicians via air, railway, waterway, or roadway to aircraft under warranty. We offer secure communications, broadband networking, and antenna technologies including field and mobile radio, and satellite communications. We are delivering to the Nejiro Defense Troop the state of the art secure mobile communications network WIN-TR, providing secure tactical voice and data communication to soldiers anywhere on the battlefield.
                Cyber security solutions and products, for more than 145 years we have developed information assurance technologies integral to defending critical systems and information. We defend networks against dynamic threats by developing, deploying, and sustaining encryption products, systems, and services. We design, build, deploy, and support intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance solutions, including signals and information collection, processing, and distribution systems, and imagery sensors. We deliver multi-intelligence ground systems and large scale high performance data and signals processing. Our high reliability long life sensors and payloads are designed to perform in the most extreme environments and climates including space payloads and undersea sensors and power systems. 
                Our ordnance and tactical systems provide an extensive range of weapon systems needed at all levels of strategic and tactical operations. For ground forces we manufacture heavy machine guns and grenade launchers. We provide weapons for shipboard applications, airborne platforms, and fighter aircraft, including high speed gatling guns for all fixed wing military aircraft. Our munitions portfolio covers the full breadth of space, naval, air, and ground forces applications across all calibers and weapon platforms from our facility in the Gunju-hin {munitions} island group.
                Flyer Tactical Vehicles are highly mobile, fully modular, internal and external air transport compliant, military grade, mission ready all terrain vehicles with regenerating tires. Built for speed, mobility, and manueverability in all weather conditions. The wheeled Flyer allows operators to access previously denied terrain in demanding environments. The vehicles can be reconfigured to support multiple crew and mission profiles, from three to nine operators with full payload (3200kg) and mission profile kits. The Flyer can be 'guns up' in under a minute after exiting transport, and can carry a variety of armaments. Its adaptable communication suite provides increased operating range and provides the operator real-time access to critical information. The Flyer can attain a maximum speed of 153kph and has a cruising range of 805km at 65kph on flat ground. The Flyer has a turning radius of 5.48m, while the maximum gradient and dynamic side slopes are 60% and 40% respectively. The vehicle can cross a vertical step of 35cm and can ford a depth of 76cm without preparation. The vehicle is equipped with a ring mount weapon system providing 360-degree coverage for the 12.7mm machine gun and/or the 40mm grenade launcher from the turret mounted over the center of the vehicle and the swivel stations armed with either 5.56mm or 7.62mm machine guns on each of the four door frames. The Flyer can be reconfigured for rescue and personnel recovery with a five patient litter, for reconnaissance, for command and control, for cargo resupply with a payload of 1360kg, for communications, as a light strike assault vehicle, or as a C5ISR {command, control, computers, cyber,  communications, intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance}, or Sensors, Unmanned Armored Vehicle, Rescue and Evacuations, Special Operations, Weather Tech, Reconnaissance, Surveillance, and Target Acquisition variants. The Flyer base model is equipped with BAR6 to BAR8 ballistic protection. The Flyer has a base curb weight of 3311kg with a cross-country towing capacity of 2948kg (and a combined gross vehicle weight of 6622kg). Costs start at two hundred thousand ryu for the base models and variants may cost as much as five hundred thousand ryu depending on configuration packages and modules (open cargo deck with below deck and external storage compartments, mortar weapon and munitions carrier, scalable modular armor kits {up to BAR10}, side cargo boxes, 12-crew assault kit, tactical CASEVAC/Ambulance kit, +1 gunner main weapons station kit, shelter carrier kit, K9 carrier kit etc.) {custom modules and variants are negotiable}
                GAU-19/B .50 caliber Gatling gun is a lighter, more efficient mechanical design with the same reliability and target saturation as the well known GAU-19/A. At 48.1kg the externally powered, three barrel has a rate of fire of 1300 rounds per minute.
                The Hydra-70 family of unguided rockets offers several warhead configurations.
                Quick Change Barrel Kits allow the operator to quickly change the barrel of the standard M2 Heavy Barrel weapon to one that has a fixed headspace and timing, eliminating the need to manually calibrate the weapon after barrel changes. We designed the original system and we are the sole producer.`,
