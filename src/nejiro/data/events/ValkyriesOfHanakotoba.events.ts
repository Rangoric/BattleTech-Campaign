        text: `So welcome to what could be our new home. I'm working with other senior staff to build out a repository of information about everything from what you can get the best Gyro, to where you can have a nice relaxing weekend.
The official language on this planet is Japanese, and so as of today we will also be taking this as our shared language instead of Swedish. I am recommending that if you don't know Japanese, that you start learning, because that nice relaxing weekend? Won't be so relaxing when you can't talk to anyone. Any lessons on Japanese or planetary etiquette are available and can be taken as part of your training.
And on the topic of training, I want us to get to 33% in training, with 2-3 GSF capable deployments. Language and etiquette will not take units out of action so get that in early. Also, while I find out the finer details of available training, we will be having 1 movie a day of un subtitled local Japanese cinema playing in the rec room. Even those of us who know Japanese should take part in language training as the specific version of Japanese might be different.
After a meeting with the GSF, it is mostly agreed that Draconis Combine C3 units will be the standard. So those interacting with them might want a primer on that.
About the previous escort, Ambrosia said 'The only good time to ambush this convoy is before or after it happens.
In related news Kem will filling in as our Jukebox during on base lunches for a week. Have those requests ready, and don't forget to pick what language you want to hear it in.`,
      },
      "Game Effects: All VoH personnel are training in local Japanese language and customs. Ambrosia made a bet with Kem that there wouldn't be anything attacking the convoy, and Kem lost so will spend a week singing random songs in random languages. Starting to transition C3 units to DC instead of Rasalhague.",
