But, the cops that we saw, they had no lights, no line of sight and moved in tandem anyway. Not one of them acted out or mistimed their move.",

If someone needs help with experiments, and we can confirm that it won't be unabled to be deployed if needed, we can let Alphonse help with the Daimyo. The only ECM we have is on the Schiltron, but that's off for training, but if that can help, we can talk when they get back, or buying an ECM piece if needed is also an option. They are expensive, but those crystals keep me up at night. Too much is unknown about them, and they fascinate me.",

That way at least when I start asking, I can get their thoughts, and any more information before I run it up the flagpole as it were. I will make sure to start with it being a talk about the mission, so only people who know about it will be asked.",

Security and regulations on this planet won't allow us to do as you have been doing. In fact, if we want to stay here long term, I'll be talking with all family members not officially working for us.",

      "Jasmine Or'lient:You didn't read the contract. We are signed up for a year. In the research I did ahead of time, at least 1 member of the GSF has already become a citizen, with land holdings. Another runs a BA repair shop. Another has a restaurant. Another has a blasted Gauss ammo plant. People don't come here to visit. Look at the pictures attached to mission reports. There is bound to be a civil war at some point, or WoB nonsense. But that can happen anywhere. What we have here, right now, is a lot of people who want to stay, and, to put it rudely, hate the same people we hate. We don't know nearly everything about this place, or if we are even on the right side of whatever seems to be brewing here. But I'm so tired of running and the scenery here is to die for.",

After the month and a half you are gone, I plan to have some things in motion, and either we can hold the ceremony and stay longer than the year, or we can start making plans for were to go. But there are kids and families we just can't expect them to keep moving. I plan to get an opinion from everyone. I already know your answer.",

        text: `So welcome to what could be our new home. I'm working with other senior staff to build out a repository of information about everything from what you can get the best Gyro, to where you can have a nice relaxing weekend.
The official language on this planet is Japanese, and so as of today we will also be taking this as our shared language instead of Swedish. I am recommending that if you don't know Japanese, that you start learning, because that nice relaxing weekend? Won't be so relaxing when you can't talk to anyone. Any lessons on Japanese or planetary etiquette are available and can be taken as part of your training.
And on the topic of training, I want us to get to 33% in training, with 2-3 GSF capable deployments. Language and etiquette will not take units out of action so get that in early. Also, while I find out the finer details of available training, we will be having 1 movie a day of un subtitled local Japanese cinema playing in the rec room. Even those of us who know Japanese should take part in language training as the specific version of Japanese might be different.
After a meeting with the GSF, it is mostly agreed that Draconis Combine C3 units will be the standard. So those interacting with them might want a primer on that.
About the previous escort, Ambrosia said 'The only good time to ambush this convoy is before or after it happens.
In related news Kem will filling in as our Jukebox during on base lunches for a week. Have those requests ready, and don't forget to pick what language you want to hear it in.`,
