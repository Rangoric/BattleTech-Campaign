# Or'lient Family History

The Or'lient family has been a member of Rasalhague for centries starting on Rasalhague itself. They have suffered oppression under the Draconis Combine, and took part in talks for the Free Rasalhague Republic to form, dealing with local diplomats on various planets.

Daisy was a part of these talks, Rose being more of a chef. Daisy had recently had the twins and Indigo so wanted then be a part of that push to finally get out of under the Combine's yoke so her children wouldn't need to grow up that way.

Jasmine and Ambrosia were born to Daisy and Alphonse in the year 3030. Indigo came along a couple years later.

Jasmine and Ambrosia joined up with the Rasalhague military, and due to their mother's connections, ended up working for Comstar as Rasalhague representatives. With the Clan Bear & Clan Wolf invasion, they left their work for Comstar to help the Rasalhague military, mostly getting refugees and others that wanted out of under the Clans off world.

## 3050s

Jasmine and Ambrosia participated in early battles against the Clans and saw the writing on the wall. Their commander was KIA in one of the battles and Jasmine focused on getting the rest of the unit out. With so much of Rasalhague in disarray, Jasmine tried to regroup with other units, but ended up moving refugees off world where she could. This earned her unit the nickname of Valkyries, as they would swoop in, grab who they could and lead the others to where more could be picked up. Eventually, she was promoted and given her own command with an unspoken mission of evacuation. If she was assigned to a planet or battle, she would be in charge of clearing a path and getting people off world. By 3052, Jasmine has resettled her family on Ueda, and Ambrosia was taking some time off to be with her children.

After the Battle of Tukayyid, Jasmine was stationed there now as a representative of Rasalhague to the Star League. During this time she met Kem Icetoff while doing humanitarian missions in various areas, post clan invasion, and hit it off.

## 3060s

With the Word of Blake's successful attack on Terra, Jasmine knew more had to be going on. So after how reactive and awful the Clan Invasion was for her family. She started working with Daisy and Ambrosia to relocate.

She started work on getting a ship that their families can use to relocate again. Get permission for her family to retire from Rasalhague and leave, and talk to the Draconis Combine for passage. They wanted to head away from the war and that direction seemed to be the best. And they had the most connection there.

She spent most of the decade preparing for this departure, including convincing her family that it was time.

The Free Rasalhague Republic didn't want to let Jasmine and her family leave, since her family has a deep history with them, but did see that she was going anyways. Instead of having/letting her retire, they gave her the permission to act as a representative of Rasalhague, and they hope that one day they will be back.

She wanted to give her unit the choice, and when presenting her crew with this plan, just about all of the officers and many of the troops insisted on staying behind. Ulam and Kem being the notable exceptions. Her father has been a well known doctor and has taken over as senior medical officer, while the rest of Kem's family has had military training (Ragnar & Kareth still enlisted just transferring to her unit) and has taken positions in the infantry.

## 3067

Jasmine was able to get the ship and get the families going off Tukayyid shortly before Blakists attacked.

Worried that they would just keep advancing, like the Clans before them, Jasmine has been heading to the Periphery and out to somewhere there is a settlement to at least take a break, on a mostly unaffiliated world, to keep her family, and the families of her unit safe. Draconis mostly let them be as they knew there was no intent to stay put, and Ambrosia's husband was once in the Draconis Military, so still had some pull.

## Family Facts

The family happens to be generally matriarchal. But this is more that a woman keeps getting put in charge (or taking charge as is currently the case), than it is some tradition. Aunt Rose was the previous head of the house, with Daisy being their representative out and about.

Children born into the family are named after some kind of flower or plant.

Jasmine is a bit of a mythology nerd, so insists that call signs are mythological. This was not followed at first, but once word got to them about the Blakists attacks on various words and what was going on, they got together without Jasmine and came up with a set of call signs that fit what she wanted, as thanks.
