# Or'lient Family History

The Or'lient family has been a member of Rasalhague for centries starting on Rasalhague itself. They have suffered oppression under Draconis Combine, and took part in talks for the Free Rasalhague Republic to form, dealing with local diplomats on various planets.

At the time Daisy was the one to have actually taken part, and after that Jasmine and Ambrosia joined up with the Rasalhague military, and due to their mother's connections, ended up working for Comstar as Rasalhague representatives. With the Clan Bear & Clan Wolf invasion, they left their work for Comstar to help the Rasalhague military, mostly getting refugees and others that wanted out of under the Clans off world.

## 3050s

Jasmine and Ambrosia participated in early battles against the Clans and saw the writing on the wall. Their commander was KIA in one of the battles and Jasmine focused on getting the rest of the unit out. With so much of Rasalhague in disarray, Jasmine tried to regroup with other units, but ended up moving refugees off world where she could. She was promoted and given her own command with an unspoken mission of evacuation. If she was assigned to a planet or battle, she would be in charge of clearing a path and getting people off world. By 3052, Jasmine has resettled her family on Ueda, and Ambrosia was taking some time off to be with her children.

After the Battle of Tukayyid, Jasmine was stationed there now as a representative of Rasalhague to the Star League. During this time she met Kem Icetoff while doing humanitarian missions in various areas and hit it off.

## 3060s

With the Word of Blake taking over Terra, Jasmine started having flashbacks to the Clan invasion. She started working with Daisy and Ambrosia with 2 goals in mind.

1. Work to get a ship that their families can use to relocate again.
2. Get permission from Rasalhague to fully retire and leave, and from the Draconis Combine for passage.

She spent most of the decade preparing for this departure, including convincing her family that it was time.

The Free Rasalhague Republic didn't want to let Jasmine leave, since her family has a deep history with them, but did see that she was going anyways. Instead of having/letting her retire, they gave her the permission to act as a representative of Rasalhague, and they hope that one day they will be back.

When presenting her crew with this plan, just about all of the officers and many of the troops insisted on staying behind. Ulam and Kem being the notable exceptions. A lot of her family has military experience or has enlisted to be under her command.

## 3067

Jasmine was able to accomplish her tasks and managed to get the last of her family off Tukayyid shortly before Blakists attacked.

Worried that they would just keep advancing, like the Clans before them, Jasmine has been heading to the Periphery and out to somewhere there is a settlement to at least take a break, on a mostly unaffiliated world, to keep her family, and the families of her unit safe. Draconis mostly let them be as they knew there was no intent to stay put, and Ambrosia's husband was once in the Draconis Military, so still had some pull.

## Family Facts

The family happens to be generally matriarchal. But this is more that a woman keeps getting put in charge (or taking charge as is currently the case), than it is some tradition. Aunt Rose was the previous head of the house, with Daisy being their representative out and about.

Children born into the family are named after some kind of flower or plant.

Jasmine is a bit of a mythology nerd, so insists that call signs are mythological. This was not followed at first, but once word got to them about the Blakists attacks on various words and what was going on, they got together without Jasmine and came up with a set of call signs that fit what she wanted, as thanks.

# People

## Kem Icetoff - XO & Would be Wife

The Icetoff family was once Capellan, but was home to a world that ended up as a part of Rasalhague. Kem was born after that change, and her family adjusted fairly well to the change of pace. Being way out of the way from the Rasalhague itself, and on the fringe of Capellan space, there was some impact, but less than there was for Jasmine's family.

While Jasmine projects her personality as a protector and leader of the family, Kem works behind that with the actual people. Way more in tune with how people are feeling than Jasmine, Kem is able to keep her family and the unit running smoothly. She was assigned as a diplomatic liaison for Jasmine while she was working in Capellan space, and when told about Jasmine plan, was the first to accept to go along with it.

## Ulam - Chief Tech

Best way to describe this miscreant is with a quote.

"Ulam has been my technician since I joined the military. He was never high ranked, or interested in raising his rank, but always had a grander plan for each person's mech. His main fault would be that, to him, mechs are personal, and shouldn't ever 'just' have something replaced. He'll do it, because the enemy won't wait, but will always come up with a holistic plan and reasoning for any changes. Once I had my own command and could pick a chief tech, I put him in the position. He grumbled about it and still does, but he does like how he can come up with a plan and not have to do all the work. When he does end up in the field, he'll pilot the LRM Carrier because we're afraid of what he'd do if he saw what we put these mechs through up close." - Jasmine

## Ambrosia - Lance Leader & Older Twin Sister

While twins, Jasmine is way more thoughtful and cerebral than Ambrosia, who is very hands on.

While Jasmine leads the unit, Ambrosia leads the Mech Lance. So while Jasmine is effectively a member of the lance, and outranks Ambrosia in general, Jasmine will defer to her if they are both on the field. So while Jasmine will be laying out the strategic goals and movements, Ambrosia will make sure the lance is armed, ready, and able to complete those goals.

Ambrosia married Arima Kazutomo from the Draconis Combine's military after they had a mock battle between their respective factions that ended in a draw. The Or'lient name actually had some weight (not much but some) even in Draconis Combine, so Arima took her name, and their four children (Akira, Orchid, Chrysanthemum, and Dahlia) are considered part of the Or'lient family.

She's the pilot of the BJ2-OB, but isn't as attached to it or it's look as Jasmine is to the MAD-3D look.

The elder two children (Akira, Orchid) have military training and are old enough, while Chrys and Dahlia are too young yet, but in training.

## Orchid - Lance XO & Eldest Daughter of Ambrosia

Orchid really looks up to both her mother and Jasmine for what they've done. Ambrosia has the same emotional blindness that Jasmine can have, so Orchid takes on that role for her as Kem does for Jasmine. Spends a lot of time chatting with Kem and learning from her.

## Arima Kazutomo - Armoured Platoon Leader & Husband of Ambrosia

Was an officer for the Draconis Combine for years before fighting to a draw with Ambrosia. After getting a permanent leg injury (playing soccer with Akira & Orchid, not in a battle to his chagrin), he was put on desk duty. With Jasmine scooping up his family he retired, and Jasmine put him in the AJAX B, which while still without good use of his leg, can still command it effectively.

## Akira - Armoured Platoon XO & Son of Ambrosia & Arima

A sniper in a local militia, and a licensed pilot, Akira is even more hands on for things that his mother. He joined Jasmine and moved his family early on, as he has heard many stories of what happened during the clan invasion from both sides of his family. Jasmine had him try some things out and see which VTOL would fit him, and the Yellow Jacket was a perfect fit. At first they thought he'd pilot a transport, but being responsible for so many others and getting that close to combat both didn't sit well with him.

He's the Armoured Platoon XO to soften the impact the Rasalhague troops have with his father. More softening him towards them as opposed to their thoughts on Arima.

## Iris - Infantry Platoon Leader & Eldest of Aunt Rose

Iris has been in the military for only a shot while less than Jasmine, but was infiltration & special operations. She fills the same role now for Jasmine that she did before.

She has, by far, the most experience in charge of an infantry unit than anyone else in the unit, aside from Starr.

Husband died in a skirmish with bandits, while driving a truck that was attacked by some bandits. Their son, Clem, is an accountant.

## Amber - Infantry Platoon XO & Younger Daughter of Iris

Just like Jasmine and Ambrosia are very different, Iris and Amber have a similar difference.

Amber is a born leader on and off the battlefield, that hates leading. Iris loves leading, but off the battlefield has her own world.

So Amber, aside from being XO, is basically the moral officer on the ship. She knows everyone, their families, who they may have had to leave behind, their family histories. All of it. But she seems to shine a bit too bright for her husbands, of which she is on her fourth. She has six children who all spend their time with their fathers. Two ex-husbands are actually traveling with them (all were asked), so that's four of her six children are with her.

She travels with the Maxim, and it's 4 squads of infantry.

## Starr Icetoff - Senior NCO & Father of Kem

Aside from Kem who now drives a tank (bleh), Starr comes from a long line of infantry army brats. Became a huge Fan of the Ying Long Battle Armor the first time he saw it in action, or didn't see it, which he thought was amazing. So now him, and his family, make up the OMNI BA platoon for Jasmine. It's all Ying Long for now, as they are brand new.

## Indigo - Younger Brother

Younger brother by almost 10 years to Ambrosia & Jasmine, he's way more mellow. He's the pilot of the Karnov transport, and very good at getting his 2 squads of BA to where they need to be. Almost didn't come along as he was a civilian pilot, but didn't want to miss watching his nieces and nephew grow up.
